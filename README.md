## Adaptive adversarial 
### Introduction
This project is the code for paper Adaptive Adversarial samples based Active learning for medical image classification based on python and pytorch framework.
  

### Requirements  
The main package and version of the python environment are as follows
```
# Name                    Version         
python                    3.8.5                    
pytorch                   1.10.1         
torchvision               0.11.2         
cudatoolkit               10.2.89       
cudnn                     7.6.5           
matplotlib                3.3.2              
numpy                     1.19.2        
opencv                    4.6.0.66         
pandas                    1.1.3               
scikit-learn              0.23.2                
tqdm                      4.50.2             
```  

The above environment is successful when running the code of the project. Pytorch has very good compatibility. Thus, I suggest that try to use the existing pytorch environment firstly.

```
### 2) Datasets preparation 
1. Download the datasets from the official address:
   
   Messidor: https://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor/

   BreakHis: https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/breast-cancer-histopathological-database-breakhis/
   
   Breast Cancer Diagnosis: https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/
2. Modify the data folder path for specific dataset in `data.py`

### 3) Run Active learning process 
Please confirm the configuration information in the [`utils.py`]
```
  python main.py \
      --n_round 34 \
      --n_query 20 \
      --n_init_labeled 100 \
      --dataset_name Messidor \
      --traning_method supervised_train_acc \
      --strategy_name RandomSampling \
      --seed 2022
```
The training results will be saved to the corresponding directory(save name) in `performance.csv`.  
You can also run `supervised_baseline.py` by
```
python supervised_baseline.py
```

## Visualization
1 Active learning performance visualization  
After you got the `performance.csv`, you can run `visualization.py` to visualize the whole process
